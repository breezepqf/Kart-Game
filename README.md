# Kart Game
 A racing car game based on unity demo 'Karting Microgame'. 


## New feature

QTE (Quick Time Event) system. Player needs to press the corresponding key (One of J, K, L) according to certain QTE button occurring in game randomly. If the correct key pressed in time, the player will get a short-time acceleration bonus, which gives the player a chance to achieve better race results, but makes the car harder to manipulate as well. 

## Implementation details

### Carâ€™s direction control

Considering the comfort of the left and right hands, we set W, A, S, D to control the car instead of UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.
When the user presses the direction button, the script will record the direction, and control the front wheel turn to corresponding direction. Our car is rear wheel drive, front wheels are mainly used to controls steering direction.

### Acceleration and fire trail

The acceleration feature is developed based on a PowerUp class, which will add a number to the speed and acceleration of the car.
The fire trail is a cool effect during acceleration. We obtain it from the Unity Assets Store and set it in each wheel. 
We write a script to monitor the results of QTE. When player presses a correct key, the script will enable the fire trails and create a powerup object to speed up the car. Then there is a short cooling down time, and the speed of the car will gradually slow down to the normal number.

### QTE

In this QTE part, we set a button-like image to represent the QTE content in the canvas and the car will speed up if the player pressed the correct button. The default background color of QTE button is blue. If the player did not press the correct button according to the hint on the button or player did not react in 3.5 seconds after the QTE button appears, the background color of button will be red. If the QTE is correct, the background color will turn to green. It is a intelligible mechanism to represent the QTE outcome.

The QTE function is mainly accomplished with two coroutines. The QTE event will be triggered with 3-10s intervals which is controlled by a Random Function. One coroutine counts the seconds the player uses to react to the QTE event. Another coroutine monitors the event of key pressing (GetkeyDown) and help judge if the pressed key is correct.
